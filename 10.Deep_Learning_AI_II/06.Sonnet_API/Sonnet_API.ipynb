            "Normal computers process information in bits that can have a value of either 0 or 1. Quantum computers use quantum bits or \"qubits\" that can represent 0, 1, or a quantum superposition of both 0 and 1 at the same time. This means qubits can exist as 0 and 1 simultaneously until they are measured.\n",
            "\n",
            "Qubits take advantage of quantum properties like superposition and entanglement. Entanglement allows groups of qubits to become intertwined in a way that the state of one particle can depend on the other, even if separated by large distances.\n",
            "\n",
            "This superposition and entanglement of qubits allows quantum computers to crunch through an enormous number of potential outcomes simultaneously. For certain problems, this could allow them to process information exponentially faster than classical computers.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, qubits are extremely fragile and errors can ruin their quantum states. This makes building stable, large-scale quantum computers immensely challenging. But companies and researchers are making progress by using ultra-cooled temperatures, isolating qubits, and developing error correction techniques.\n",
